# EqualLogic Host Integration Tools Parameters
[HIT Params]

# Logging Level (0 = off, 3 = most verbose)
DebugLevel = 2

# If 'false' (default), leaves logs to be rotated by an external facility
# such as logrotate(8).  If 'true', manually rotates the logs once they reach

# Remote Setup Wizard Configuration Parameters
[RSW Config]

# Timeout used by internal protocol for discovering EqualLogic arrays

# initialization, following array discovery
Setup Timeout = 240


# EqualLogic Automatic Snapshot Manager Parameters
[ASM Params]

# Root directory for saving backup documents
SmartCopyDirectory = /var/lib/equallogic/asm/smart-copies/


# EqualLogic Multipathing Configuration Parameters
[MPIO Params]

# Whether to enable MPIO session management
EnableMPIO = true

# Maximum number of MPIO sessions to be used per member per volume
MaxConnectionsPerMember = 2

# Maximum number of MPIO sessions to be used for entire volume
MaxDevicesPerMpioSession = 6

# Maximum number of MPIO sessions to create from this host
MaxMpioSession = 1024

# Number of seconds between checking the health of all managed sessions.
SessionPollingInterval = 15

# Whether to use MPIO for snapshots
UseMPIOForSnapshots = true

# If enabled, only IPv4 addresses can be used by MPIO
UseIPv4 = true

# MPIO will use adapters that meet the minimum speed requirement below
MinAdapterSpeed = 1000

# Load Balancing policy for MPIO:  
#    round-robin (or 2)
#    queue-length (or 4) - Not supported on all kernels
# (Automatically falls back if the selected type is not available)
LoadBalanceType = queue-length

# How many IOs to issue on each path in a multipath device before switching.
# This is equivalent to the rr_min_io parameter in the multipath config file

# Which iSCSI initiator to use.  Valid choices are:
#  tcp    - this is the software initiator and is the default behavior
#  bnx2i  - this is the Broadcom iSCSI offload initiator
IscsiInitiator = tcp

# If enabled, only IPv6 addresses can be used by MPIO
UseIPv6 = false


# Volume specific configuration parameters
# It is possible to modify the IOPerPath, LoadBalanceType, MaxDevicesPerMPIOSession 
# MaxConnectionsPerMember, and EnableMPIO on a per volume basis.  Define a
# section with the name "MPIO Volume Params VOLNAME" where VOLNAME is the name
# of the volume.  Wildcards can be used in the VOLNAME.

# Example: 
# [MPIO Volume Params VOLNAME]
# IOPerPath = 16

# Minimum amount of free space as a percentage of capacity.
